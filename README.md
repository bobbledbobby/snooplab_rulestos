## Server: Community Guidelines
_These are the Community Guidelines or, as most people call rules of the "Snoopy's Labatory", "Snooplab" for short (which is the support server for the bots that BotGhost and I made_

### 1. Be respectful towards others. 

1.1. Do not troll the server. This means pretending you are bypassing a ban, pretending to be the owner by using your role perms irresponsibly…

1.2. Don’t be toxic to members. This means that bullying or harassment is prohibited. We can’t list every single way bullying can happen, just don’t be toxic. If you are being toxic, action will be taken. Hate speech is also prohibited.

1.3. Don’t be sexist, racist, LBBTQIA+-phobia. Serious action will be taken.

### 2. You must follow the Discord Community Guidelines and ToS
2.1. Do not participate in any activity that in any way breaks Discord Community Guidelines or ToS. 

2.2. You must be old enough to use Discord in your country (if you are confused, click [this](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday))

2.3. Do not age bait, this means asking “how many days are in a week”. If you really don’t know, then you shouldn’t be on Discord in the first place.


2.4. Do not install any client mods or use plugins that may harm Discord and its servers. API exploits are included.

Also, don’t send links that sole purpose of the link is to grab your IP (Grabify links included)

### 3. Do not use offensive language.
Offensive language includes but is not limited to words and terms that may break our rules, terms that are NSFW/racist or commonly blocked.

3.1. Swearing is not allowed on the server. You may swear when you unlock certain roles & channels but most roles & channels do not facilitate swearing. This is to help enforce rule 1. 

3.2. Do not use terms that may refer to sexually explicit behavior, NSFW terms, insults or slurs

Content blocked by our AutoMod:
Spam mentioning, spam content, offensive language (swearing), insults, slurs, terms that refer to explicit behavior/activity, invite links, anti staff ping, links
 
### 4. Do not use alternative (alt) accounts in a deceptive way:

4.1. Don’t use alt accounts to give yourself a higher chance to win giveaways.

4.2. Don’t use alt accounts to bypass another punishment given to an another account.

### 5. You may not advertise on the server.

5.1. Advertising your social media or Discord server is prohibited. You may advertise in #self-advertising if you meet requirements.

5.2. Soft advertising, this means talking about your server without a link is also prohibited.

5.3. Do not DM advertise, this means DMing a user your social media or Discord server without the receiver’s agreement.

5.4. Do not tell people where they could find something. For example, if user A is asking for your social media on the server, DM it to them. If you say “it’s on my profile” or “search for () on google”, you are advertising without user B’s agreement.

### 6. Don’t be annoying in Voice Channels
6.1. Don’t earr*pe or scream. This means screaming or putting on really loud noises to annoy people

6.2. Do not use the Soundboard in any way that could break the rules or break rule 6.1.

6.3. Do not record others inside VCs as it could be an invasion of privacy. Ask everyone in the VC if you can record it first.

### 7. Inappropriate Content outside of age-restricted channels is strictly prohibited.

7.1. Don’t talk about it. This is a topic on the server that should be avoided at all times. If you have concerns about this, DM a staff member with the @nsfw reports role.

7.2. Don’t send NSFL/gore/illegal content on the server. No one wants to see that.

7.3. NSFW/P*rnography/nudity is not allowed on the server. You may get banned for posting this type of content.

7.4. No suggestive/cropped/blurred/pixelated content. Even if the prohibited content is sent but is cropped, blurred, pixelated, action will still be taken. Sexually suggestive content is also prohibited.

7.5. Do not tell people where they could find such content.

7.6. Do not flirt/date/be horny with people on the server. Sending virtual hugs is allowed though.

### 8. Do not bypass AutoMod.
 
8.1. Bypassing AutoMod by using lookalikes, spaces are prohibited.

8.2. Don’t censor bad words halfway. For example “s***” is not allowed.

8.3. Don’t misuse spoilers. This means using spoilers to make others think you are breaking rules. An example of this can be frick.
8.4. Don’t abuse reply pings, this means replying to someone else and saying something irrelevant to bypass the anti-ping.

### 9. Don’t spam ping or be annoying.

9.1. If there are no mods in chat, and someone is breaking rules, please ping @>modneeded. Misuse will result in a ban.

9.2. Be mature. Don’t use arguments like “didn’t ask”, “don’t care”, “who asked” or similar. You will be punished.
 
9.3. Only the pronouns “any, ask, he/him, she/her, they/them, she/they, he/they” can be used in your nickname, bio or pronouns box in your user settings.

9.4. Don’t impersonate other people. Pretending to be someone else that you’re not (alts are exceptions) will result in serious punishment.



## Extra Rules
*These rules are rules that may seem kinda weird outside of Snooplab but in Snooplab, these are considered normal rules.*

Do not find loopholes in rules. Finding loopholes in rules will just give you punishments just as if you broke a rule without loopholing anything.

Do not ghost ping. Ghost pinging means that you ping someone and edit or delete your message & remove the ping. This action is forbidden. If you make a mistake and didn’t mean to ping, just apologize but do not remove the ping.

The rules 1, 2, 3.2 7, 9.4, 6.3 are expected to be followed at all times, even when you are outside of Snooplab. If you break these rules, even outside of Snooplab, you might still face punishment.

We reserve all rights to report any content sent (even if it was deleted/blocked by our AutoMod) to Discord Staff

Do not spam, this includes sending or pinging people repeatedly. Headings (markdown), z̷̡͎̦̥͕͇͎̙͍͙̠̟̫͙͘͝͝ͅả̵̛̘͙͐͊̈̎̓̊̽̃́̎̌̕̚̚ͅl̷̨̧̬͎̳̣̠̭̲̱̒͛̈́͗͐̈́́̐̅͑̋͝g̵̨̰̓̓ó̶̧͖͖͙̙̭͕͓̟̟̯̪̺̫̰̍͆̀̄̿́͆̕͝ or weird fonts are also prohibited.

Don’t use “I forgot to read the rules”, “I didn’t read the rules” as an excuse to break rules. Everyone in the server is required to follow rules.

Don’t be annoying. If people are telling you to stop doing something, stop doing it.

English only. Most Staff in Snooplab speak English so we can’t take much action if you say something that goes against our rules in other languages. Please use other servers or translating services.

Staff has final say. If you believe you are getting warned for anything that isn’t a rule, please refer to rule 5 or contact someone with the @DM for In-Server-Appeals role.
